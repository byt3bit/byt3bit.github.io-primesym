MiMC is block cipher and hash function family designed specifically for SNARK applications. The low multiplicative complexity of MiMC over prime field makes it
suitable for ZKSNARK applications such as ZCash.

The MiMC block cipher uses the Even-Mansour (EM) mode. Each round is constructed using the APN function ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x^3) over a large field.
